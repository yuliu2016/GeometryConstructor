Welcome to the Geometric Constructor

You can use this program to model compass-and-straightedge geometric constructions
Read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction

The program provides you with two fixed points to start the construction

You can use the following keyboard commands:

Select: Select or deselect entities by clicking on them
Delete: Delete selected entities

0 / H : Hide selected entities or show all
1 / P : Construct a new point on the intersection of two existing geometries
2 / C : Construct a circle on two existing points. First select the center point, then select the radius
3 / L : Construct a line on two existing points by selecting them

+ / - : Zoom in or out of view
Arrows: Pan the view
